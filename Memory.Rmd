# Introduction

On the past few years, online betting has experienced a boom that has lead to proliferation of website offering this service. The question that arises is then, there is any difference across all the webistes regarding the odds? Or all of them offer the same odd for a given bet and the main difference might be other services the different portals offer?

In order to give an answer to this question, the first thing to do is to analyze how odds are defined by bookmakers.
