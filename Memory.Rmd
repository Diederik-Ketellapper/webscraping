## The Big Ass Project: Webscraping
# Preface

This project aims to showcase the adquired skills during the course MAP 351 Introduction to R of the master's degree MSc Data Science for Business. The main goals of this project is to use and implement the different R capabilities shown in class, but at the same time develop a tool which may have some practical interest. In that sense the topic of the project was open, and we decided to go for online betting in Europe.

With the following project we aim to cover the following points of the course:

+ Github: We are working online from Barcelona and Amsterdam)
+ Shiny app: the results will be showcased in a shiny app.
+ Web-scraping: use to collect odd data from the different websites.
+ Data Manipulating and presenting: when dealing with the data from the different websites.
+ Package making: the final result is pretended to be delivered as a package.

# Introduction

On the past few years, online betting has experienced a boom that has lead to proliferation of website offering this service. The question that arises is then, there is any difference across all the webistes regarding the odds? Or all of them offer the same odd for a given bet and the main difference might be other services the different portals offer?

In order to give an answer to this question, the first thing to do is to analyze how odds are defined by bookmakers. We are going to make a really quick introduction on the mathematics of bookmaking, and we highly recommend the interested reader to check .

To keep it simple the odds of a particular bet are defined by the bookmaker following these steps:

1. Betting houses define which one they think is the real probability of the event happening based on the available data and their own algorithms. Putting it simple for a binary event like a coin toss we now that the probability of getting heads is 0.5, then the odd for this event is defined as 1 to 2 so if you bet 10 € and get heads you will obtain 20 €.

2. Once the odd asociated with the real probability is defined, bookmakers add their own comission usually around 6% in the industry. Going back to the coin example with a 6% charges the odd will be 1.88 so the payout will go down to 18.8 € and your margin from 10 € to 8.8 €.

3. In order to ensure their profit, bookmakers adjust odds to attract bets in the right proportion in each side, in order to secure a profit regardless of the outcome of the event. This is achieved by offering odds that are higher than the actual statistical probability of the event concerned.

With this being said, it can be seen that due to de odds defining process is unlikely that the odds of two different bookmakers will be exactly the same, first of all due to different comissions across bookmakers and most importantly due to the arbitrage applyied ensure profit by them that generates artificial odds from which we can take advantage.

In order to help the bettor to take a more informed decision and place the bet with the best odd available we will develop a shiny app comparing the data from the 5 principal betting websites in Europe that will allow comparisions between odds offered and the calculated bookmaker's margin.
